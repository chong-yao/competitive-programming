# Selection 1 checklist

This is not a scored challenge! This is just a comprehensive checklist for Selection 1.

Passing Selection 1 requires you to do the following:

1. Complete and submit the Lab3 challenge through the `competitions.aiolympiad.my` platform.
2. Ensure that you have accessed the Github classroom link at https://classroom.github.com/a/xL2MQj8p, and have uploaded Lab 2
3. Ensure that your github repo link is shown in this Google Sheet at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PzARrF0Xp1DL1F9FCu8sEoNvhA4nyvy05b8m5lMMyPU/edit?usp=sharing, AND it is correctly tagged to your competitions' username, AND Lab 2 submitted is a green "YES". Reach out otherwise, and also if you have any questions on how to do the github submission. Lab 2 needs to be in by the time I am done grading Lab 3.
4. Not actually required, but please fill in this demographics survey before you go: https://forms.office.com/r/au1cw7kYXe

Grading will take some time. Scores will be posted in the Discord server by mid-week, and classes will continue next weekend for those who qualify for further training.

Thank you for your effort!
