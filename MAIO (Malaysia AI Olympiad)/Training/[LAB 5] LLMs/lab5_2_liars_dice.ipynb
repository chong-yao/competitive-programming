    "\n",
    "3. Mathematical odds: There are 5 dice total. The bid is for one 5. Considering 1s are wild, the bid is a 1/6 chance of being true on any given die, plus the wild, which makes it likely. Alice has a die, so it could be true. Without the wild, the chance is 1 - (5/6)^5 = 0.598. With a wild, it increases significantly, but is still less than 1. Because the previous bid was for two 5s, and the current bid is for one, I need to be careful.\n",

      "   \n",
      "   **1. Analyze Your Hand:**\n",
      "   \n",
      "   *   Alice's dice: \\[1, 5, 4]\n",
      "   *   This means Alice has one \"1\" (which is wild), a \"5\", and a \"4\". This is a decent, but not spectacular hand. The \"1\" gives flexibility.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   **2. Consider Bid Likelihood Using Total Dice:**\n",
      "   \n",
      "   *   Total Dice: 4\n",
      "   *   After the challenge, the dice for each player are still in play.\n",

      "       *   *Pros:* Ends the round if correct, potentially saving dice.\n",

      "       *   *Pros:* Can potentially influence the game and shape the narrative. Can gauge the other players' dice.\n",
      "       *   *Cons:* Reveals information about your hand and the dice you are comfortable with. Can lead to difficult calls later in the game.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   **4. Strategy Considerations:**\n",
      "   \n",
      "   *   **The Previous Challenge:** The last challenge was between Alice and Bob. It ended with Alice winning. This likely means there were not a lot of dice with face value 2.\n",

      "   \n",
      "       *   **Option 1: Conservative Play - Challenge** Given that the previous challenge was between Alice and Bob, and Alice won, it is unlikely there are many 2s in play.\n",
      "       *   **Option 2: Bid** A bid can be made based on Alice's understanding of the dice in play.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   **Decision:**\n",
      "   \n",
      "   Let's see... Given that Alice won the last challenge, it is unlikely that there are many 2s in play. Given that Alice has one die with value 1, Alice can bid more dice with 1s.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   Alice bids 1 dice show 1.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   **Reasoning:**\n",

      "   \n",
      "   *   **Challenging:** Challenging carries the risk of losing if Alice's bid is valid. Given the total dice (4), it's possible Alice has a 3 or a wild (1) in her hand.\n",
      "   *   **Bidding:**\n",
      "       *   Since my die is a 3, and the current bid is 1 die showing 3, I can bid, but the risk of a challenge is high.\n",
      "       *   If I bid 2 dice showing 3, Alice could challenge me if she has no dice with 3.\n",
      "       *   If I bid 2 dice showing 4, the bid will be higher, but it makes it more likely to be challenged.\n",
